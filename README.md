## About The Project

# User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores (yes the user called for a JS quiz, but I had to go with what I enjoy on this one :)
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
